/**
 * Contains the SysMLinJava representation of the SysML standard
 * probability-distribution type elements. Included are the
 * {@code SysMLProbabilityDistribution} which is the base class of all SysML
 * probability-distribution type elements, and the SysML-specified specialized
 * probability distributions. Of course, other probability distributions can be
 * defined by extension of any of these standard distribution classes.
