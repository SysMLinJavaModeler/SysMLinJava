/**
 * Contains the SysMLinJava representations of all classes related to the
 * standard SysML state machine. It includes a class for the state machine
 * itself, as well as classes for states, pseudo-states, transitions, guards,
 * triggers, effects, etc. All classes are "final" and need only be initialized
 * within the context of the SysMLStateMachine to fully specify a state-machine
 * that can serve as the basis of an executable block model.
