/**
 * Contains the SysMLinJava representatio of the various "kinds" (enumerations)
 * in SysML. Representions as enumerated values for kinds include those for
 * kinds of call concurrencies, feature directions, and flow directions. These
 * kinds map to those of the same name in the SysML standard.
 * <p>
 * Note that the SysML quantityKinds are not included in this package insofar as
 * the quantityKinds are not enumerated values, but rather are specific
 * instances of a type.
