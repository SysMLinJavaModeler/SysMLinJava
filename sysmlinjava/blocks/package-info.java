/**
 * Contains the SysMLinJava representation of the primary element of SysML
 * models - the SysML block. The package also contains classes and interfaces
 * closely associated with {@code SysMLBlock}. This includes the
 * {@code BlockContainer} which, (along with the interprocess-enabled
 * {@code SysMLFullPort}), enables SysMLinJava models to be distributed and
 * executed across multiple operating system processes for greater scalability
 * and performance of more complex and extensive SysMLinJava models.
